# Bubble Blaster
I had a book about Python programming, and it included a tutorial on the "Bubble Blaster" game.
One day I found my Python file with this game, and I decided to remake it in Javascript.

So, here it is.


## On LICENSE
I'm not sure how should this game be licensed.
On one hand, it's been made by me, ~~so I'd release it into public domain~~.
But the original code was in the book, and I don't remember how it was licensed there and how it should be here now.

So uh... maybe I should leave it without a LICENSE file, assigning it to a "default license"?
